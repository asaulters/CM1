                    At Charlie Mike's, we are not just another restaurant - we're a gathering place, where community comes together. Nestled in the heart of Fayetteville, North Carolina, our establishment has been serving locals and visitors alike since our doors first opened.

                    Our name - "Charlie Mike's" - is military slang for "Continue Mission," and it's a motto that we embody every day. We cater to the diverse palette of our community, proudly serving not just traditional pub fare but also authentic Thai cuisine. Our menu is a testament to our commitment to variety and quality, with each dish thoughtfully created by our skilled chefs.
